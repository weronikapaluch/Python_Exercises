# Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
# For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
# Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

# Floats with decimal part non equal to zero are considered UNeven for this kata.
